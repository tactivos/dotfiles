# dotfiles ðŸ› 
 A set of pullaprove, zapper, editorconfig, eslint, babel, git, and more configuration files.
 
I was a little tired of copy and pasting files across project and trying to understand if I had the latest version or the most common configuration for each one of the files, that's what led to this project. 
If you're interested in the philosophy behind why projects like these are awesome, you might want to read my post on the subject.

## Why would I want my dotfiles on GitHub?

- Backup, restore, and sync the prefs and settings for your toolbox. Your dotfiles might be the most important files on your repo.
- Learn from the community. Discover new tools for your toolbox and new tricks for the ones you already use.
- Share what you've learned with the rest of us

## What's on the box

- **PullApprove**. Default configuration for `.pullapprove` with the common rules and criterias we share among different projects. 
- **Zappr**. Default configuration for `.zappr` with the common commit message patten we share among different projects.
